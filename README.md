# sphinx-psi-theme
Sphinx theme (extension to cloud) for Psi4 documentation

* Strictly, this theme depends only on the Cloud theme and Sphinx 1.5

* Practically, good stuff to install (including this) is:

```
conda install sphinx-psi-theme cloud_sptheme sphinx-automodapi graphviz python-graphviz sphinx -c conda-forge -c psi4
```
